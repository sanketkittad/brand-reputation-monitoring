Advaid അദ്വൈത്,"Here are some crazy stats from Swiggy:

India ordered 2.5 biryanis per second in 2023. For every 5.5 chicken biryanis, there was 01 veg biryani ordered. A swiggy user from Hyderabad ordered 1,633 biryanis this year (04 biryanis a day).

“India is a vegetarian country” is a myth."

Advaid അദ്വൈത്,do you know about Swiggy's customer base? they shared rough data about biryani. that doesn't mean every person eats that. and yes India is a vegetarian country until and unless some C-type people enter India and ruin its image.
